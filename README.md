## Hi there 👋 I'm Adal!

I am currently transitioning from a strong technical background in QA Analysis to Data Science. Combining 3+ years of experience in root-cause analysis and data-driven validation with intense training in Python, Machine Learning, and Statistical Modeling. Passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and optimize systems.

My goal is to combine my QA background with data-driven approaches and grow into a Data Scientist / Machine Learning&AI Engineer role in the long term.

Beyond technical analysis, I am a proactive community builder bringing strong communication skills to data science teams.
